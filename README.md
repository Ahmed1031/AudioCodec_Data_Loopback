# AudioCodec_Data_Loopback
This is a VHDL project for configuring audio codec WM8731 to sample audio data and looping back serial ADC output data to serial DAC input.
All the relevant constants , subtypes and record types are defined in audio_codec_pkg , this file will be updated frequently to add more i2c commands in futre .
Refer to WM8731 datasheet , tested on DE2-115 develpment board . All files written in VHDL using VHDL record types and subtype.
